### IoT Discussion

- Automation of daily life
- Easily access information
- IoT is new and difficult to develop
- 700 different possible devices for one scenario
- If you properly setup devices, you can even be woken up by a toaster.
- Personal data is saved and needs to be protected
- IoT devices can be abused (e.g. fire alarm as morning alarm)

- Example: Guy in huge company was able to control whole building 
- Also: nuclear weapons can be a potential risk
	-> Additional security measures

- New jobs
- Loosing jobs
- e.g. gas station

- No system is 100% secure
- Time & Costs
- Cisco provides certifications for security mechanisms

- Is it possible to enable secure embeded systems?
- Question about waranty and legal rights?
- What happens when a malfunctioning device causes damage?

- Environmental impact?
- No argument against IoT
- Poor people are exploited anyway
- Software is expensive

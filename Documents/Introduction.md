# IOT (Slide 14)
Systems, Connectivity, Data

- Domains
	- Smart home technology
	- Transportation
	- Wearables / Mobile Computing
	- Agriculture
	- E-commerce
	- Health care
	- Logistics
	- Interior design
	- Smart cities
	- Ubiquitous/Pervasive Computing
	- Embedded Computing
	- M2m Communication (Machine 2 Machine)
	- Hacking / Making
	- Manufactoring

- Data protocols
	- Bluetooth
	- NFC
	- COAP (based on REST, for embedded devices)
- Typical devices
	- Smart home products (door locks, Bluetooth trackers)
	- Wearables (smart watches for example)
- Benefits of IOT
	- Interconnection of devices (connect everything)
	- Knowledge is power
	- Improvement of healthcare system
	- Easier tracking of products
	- Data has value
	- Improved marketing
	- Monitor multiple different devices from one point
- Challenges of IOT
	- Very complex
	- Security is an issu (sometimes of life and death)
	- Communication across devices (multiple standards, industries)
	- Migration to newer communication networks (to LTE for example)
	- Battery life
	- People don't want multiple companies for one solution
	- Who pays for IOT?
	- Developing difficult (predicting network of cities in the future hard/impossible)
	- Growth bigger than progress
- Worked with
	- Magdalena Hametner
	- Johannes Lugstein
